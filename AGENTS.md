For changes that could affect security, you MUST threat-model the change using Oplane MCP
before committing. Threat-model the actual diff (e.g. the PR threat model), not a written
summary of it - a model built from your own description only re-tests risks you already
considered. Explicitly consider untrusted-input-inbound (log/audit/template/SQL injection
from external data), not only outward data leakage.
